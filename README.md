This repo is a [contribution](https://github.com/mozilla/global-sprint/issues/285) to the [Mozilla Global Sprint 2018](https://foundation.mozilla.org/opportunity/global-sprint/) and focused on brainstorming for the [Joint Roadmap for Open Science Tools](http://jrost.org).

We aim to improve the open science landscape systemically by bringing together a range of open projects to explore how they can be improved collectively and integrated towards a more interoperable open science ecosystem. Participants include Wikidata, Mozilla, Zotero, Hypothesis, DAT, Jupyter, bioRxiv, ORCID, Crossref, OJS, Meta, OSF, PLOS and others (see [full list](http://jrost.org/participants)).
