This repo is a [contribution](https://github.com/mozilla/global-sprint/issues/285) to the [Mozilla Global Sprint 2018](https://foundation.mozilla.org/opportunity/global-sprint/) and focused on brainstorming for the [Joint Roadmap for Open Science Tools](http://jrost.org).

We aim to improve the open science landscape systemically by bringing together a range of open projects to explore how they can be improved collectively and integrated towards a more interoperable open science ecosystem. Participants include Wikidata, Mozilla, Zotero, Hypothesis, DAT, Jupyter, bioRxiv, ORCID, Crossref, OJS, Meta, OSF, PLOS and others (see [full list](http://jrost.org/participants)).


[![Stonehenge, assembled from a variety of sources over an extended period of time](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/94/JROST_over_Stonehenge-01.png/1280px-JROST_over_Stonehenge-01.png)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:JROST_over_Stonehenge-01.png)
Stonehenge is an example where pieces from different sources had been integrated in a way that harmonized (and still does) with the surrounding landscape. We aim at a similar integration across the open science landscape that is accessible to the public and mindful of the long term, albeit with a more flexible arrangement, and closer to contemporary research workflows.
