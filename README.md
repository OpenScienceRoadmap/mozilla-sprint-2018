# Welcome

This repo is a [contribution](https://github.com/mozilla/global-sprint/issues/285) to the [Mozilla Global Sprint 2018](https://foundation.mozilla.org/opportunity/global-sprint/) and focused on brainstorming for the [Joint Roadmap for Open Science Tools](http://jrost.org).

We aim to improve the open science landscape systemically by bringing together a range of open projects to explore how they can be improved collectively and integrated towards a more interoperable open science ecosystem. Participants include Wikidata, Mozilla, Zotero, Hypothesis, DAT, Jupyter, bioRxiv, ORCID, Crossref, OJS, Meta, OSF, PLOS and others (see [full list](http://jrost.org/participants)).

Stonehenge is an example where pieces from different sources had been integrated in a way that harmonized (and still does) with the surrounding landscape. We aim at a similar integration across the open science landscape that is accessible to the public and mindful of the long term, albeit with a more flexible arrangement, and closer to contemporary research workflows.

# Coordination

We will have a [Zoom channel](https://zoom.us/j/944190942) and the [#opensciroadmap](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#opensciroadmap) channel on IRC available throughout the sprint. We will also be [monitoring](https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&vertical=default&q=OpenSciRoadmap) the [@OpenSciRoadmap](https://twitter.com/OpenSciRoadmap) handle and the [#OpenSciRoadmap](https://twitter.com/hashtag/opensciroadmap?src=hash) hashtag on Twitter.

We expect the bulk of the activities during the sprint to result in modifications to [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/OpenScienceRoadmap/mozilla-sprint-2018) and [its issue tracker](https://github.com/OpenScienceRoadmap/mozilla-sprint-2018/issues), to the [repo](https://github.com/OpenScienceRoadmap/OpenScienceRoadmap.github.io) and [issue tracker](https://github.com/OpenScienceRoadmap/OpenScienceRoadmap.github.io/issues) for the [JROST website](http://jrost.org) and (with pointers from our issue tracker) to issue trackers and other fora used by projects that form part of the open science landscape, particularly those that participate in the current Mozsprint or that participated in past ones.
