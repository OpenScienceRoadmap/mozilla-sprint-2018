# About

This file documents the use and reuse rights of outputs produced in the framework of this event. To document problems related to licensing of such outputs or of external resources (particularly when they block or limit reuse), we encourage participants to [open an issue](https://github.com/OpenScienceRoadmap/mozilla-sprint-2018/issues/new) for that and to use the [licensing](https://github.com/OpenScienceRoadmap/mozilla-sprint-2018/labels/licensing) label, so that we can track such cases.
