We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for
all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, religion,
or similar personal characteristic.

When participating online, please avoid using overtly sexual nicknames or other nicknames that
might detract from a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all.

Please be kind and courteous. There's no need to be mean or rude.
Respect that people have differences of opinion and that every design or
implementation choice carries a trade-off and numerous costs. There is seldom
a right answer, merely an optimal answer given a set of values and
circumstances.

Please keep unstructured critique to a minimum. If you have solid ideas you
want to experiment with, make a fork and see how it works.

We will exclude you from interaction if you insult, demean or harass anyone.
That is not welcome behaviour. We interpret the term "harassment" as
including the definition in the
[Citizen Code of Conduct](http://citizencodeofconduct.org/);
if you have any lack of clarity about what might be included in that concept,
please read their definition. In particular, we don't tolerate behavior that
excludes people in socially marginalized groups.

Private harassment is also unacceptable. No matter who you are, if you feel
you have been or are being harassed or made uncomfortable by a community
member, please contact one of the channel ops or any of the
[team members](https://github.com/orgs/OpenScienceRoadmap/people)
immediately. Whether you're a regular contributor to open science projects and tools 
or a newcomer, we care about
making this community a safe place for you and we've got your back.

Likewise any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting or other attention-stealing
behaviour is not welcome.
